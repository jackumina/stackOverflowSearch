# stackOverflowSearch
This project uses api.stackexchange.com (stackoverflow's api) to simulate its search feature in order to find questions on the site.
I used python to do get requests and IpyWidgets for the simple UI.

- I don't have an account that allows me to access the full dataset provided through this API so it will only link to 25 possible question/ answer pairs

How to run:
  - Copy and paste the code in the index.py file and paste it into a notebook
