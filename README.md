# stackOverflowSearch
This project uses api.stackexchange.com (stackoverflow's api) to simulate its search feature in order to find questions on the site.
I used python to do get requests and IpyWidgets for the simple UI.

How to run:
  - Copy and paste the code in the index.py file and paste it into a notebook
